#+title: ACT-IV - Actively Controlled Transfer with Integrated Versioning - Project Proposal

* The Purpose
*ACT-IV* is an open source solution to the file synchronization problem

File synchronization tools are often cluttered and overcomplicated for what they do


*ACT-IV* aims to fix this problem by allowing users to simply and efficiently sync directories across systems using git

* Usage
To set up *ACT-IV* simply create a private git repository and specify it in an *ACT-X.toml* file at *$HOME/.config/ACT-IV* where *X* can be any string to represent different repos and different synchronization jobs these are called *ACT-ROUTINES*

* Features
You can manually push a directory to it's respective repo with ~ACT-THROW~

The ~ACT-CLOCK~ daemon will keep track of time and automatically push your files as specified in your *ACT-ROUTINES*

For example you might have *ACT-NOTES.toml* configured to sync daily and *ACT-CODE.toml* configured to sync hourly

If your device is off when the time you specified passes, ~ACT-CLOCK~ will ~THROW~ your files to the repo the next time it is initiated


You can also specify a password to encrypt your files or specify compression options to compress larger directories


To retrieve your files from the target system use the ~ACT-CATCH~ command to pull from a *ACT-IV* repo, include your password to decrypt files if you chose to encrypt them


Alternatively you can use the *ACT-CATCH.toml* routine to specify which repos go to which directories and passwords for them so you can *CATCH* all of your files with one command


*ACT-ROUTINES* also include the option of setting an ntfy.sh topic to recieve notifications when a sync successfully completes or fails


If something catastrophic happens and your files are ruined you can use ~ACT-WIND~ to rewind time back to an old commit and get your files back


The *ACT-SUITE* will be available on the AUR from aur/act-suite
